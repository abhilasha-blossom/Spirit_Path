<h2 style="color:#ff69b4;">🌸 The Story</h2>

You wake up in a locked room with no memory. A note pinned to your chest reads: *"Don't leave me."*
To escape, you must navigate three distorted paths—**Seoul, Kyoto, and China**—each guarded by a spirit who claims to love you.

But there is a fourth path... a hidden **Abandoned Asylum** where the truth of your "illness" lies.
Will you escape? Will you submit? Or will you become the monster they fear?

<br/>
